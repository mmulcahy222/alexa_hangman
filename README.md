# Amazon Hangman

I made a Hang Man game for a games company, and here it is!

I collated a list of all English Words. 

There is an easy, medium & hard mode, and the modes determine the length of word you get to pick.

NOTE: I should have used the State Design Pattern for this skill (next time), and regretfully I did not use DynamoDB as I should have, it was long ago and I was new & not a certified Amazon AWS Solutions Architect yet (next time).
